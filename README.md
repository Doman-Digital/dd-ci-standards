# ci-standards

Shared CI policy, cost registry, and Renovate preset for the Doman Digital
portfolio (15 repos across 8 GitHub accounts as of 2026-08-16). Public
because both Renovate's cross-owner `extends` and GitHub's cross-owner
reusable workflows require it. Nothing in here is a secret: callers pass
their own via `secrets: inherit`.

**Status:** in use, consumed by tag (`@v1`).
**Used by:** every repo whose CI calls `policy.yml` or whose Renovate config extends `default.json`.

This exists because CI cost across the portfolio grew unchecked until it
tripped a billing block, with 400+ Actions runs/month in two repos, an 18-PR
Dependabot fan-out in one afternoon, crons added with no registry anywhere.
The point of this repo is to be the ceiling that holds by itself: new waste
has to pass a policy check to merge, not get caught in the next audit.

## What's in here

- **`budget.yml`**: the registry of every recurring cost: GitHub Actions
  `schedule:` crons and Vercel `crons:` entries, one entry per repo, each
  with a reason. `scripts/check-workflow-policy.mjs` fails a PR that adds a
  schedule or Vercel cron not listed here.
- **`.github/workflows/policy.yml`**: reusable workflow, call it from any
  repo's own CI to run the policy check against that repo:

  ```yaml
  name: ci-standards policy

  on:
    pull_request:

  # The gate has to satisfy its own [missing-concurrency] rule. Copy this
  # block along with the job or the policy workflow flags its own file on
  # every PR.
  concurrency:
    group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
    cancel-in-progress: true

  # The check only reads the repo.
  permissions:
    contents: read

  jobs:
    ci-standards-policy:
      uses: Doman-Digital/dd-ci-standards/.github/workflows/policy.yml@v1
  ```

  Checks: push+pull_request double-runs on overlapping branches, jobs
  missing `timeout-minutes`, PR-triggered workflows missing a `concurrency`
  cancel group, unregistered crons (GitHub Actions and Vercel), and
  `continue-on-error: true` with no explanatory comment.

  Two of those take an in-file opt-out, because the intent belongs where the
  next reader is standing rather than in a config file they won't open:

  - `continue-on-error: true` is accepted with a comment in the three lines
    above it.
  - A deliberate double-run is accepted with a
    `# ci-standards: allow-double-run <reason>` comment anywhere in the
    workflow. Use it for a genuine backstop: a secret scan or commit-author
    check that re-runs on push to main catches whatever reaches main without
    a PR, which is the exact case branch protection can be bypassed for.
    Scoping push to a non-overlapping branch there would delete the coverage,
    not the waste.

  Neither opt-out is a way to silence the gate on ordinary waste. A full
  test suite re-running on push to main is the thing this rule exists for.

- **`.github/workflows/node-ci.yml`**: reference reusable CI for a single
  pnpm/Node app. **Not yet adopted anywhere**: see the comment at the top
  of the file for why (existing repo CI reflects real tested logic that
  shouldn't be swapped blind while Actions billing is blocked and no run
  can verify the migration). Adopt one repo at a time once that clears.

- **`default.json`**: shared Renovate preset. Weekly Monday-morning window,
  concurrency caps, majors grouped by manager (the fix for an 18-PR fan-out
  where individually-grouped minors still let every major land separately),
  automerge on devDependencies and patch bumps only. Vulnerability handling
  is the deliberate exception to all of the above: `osvVulnerabilityAlerts`
  + `vulnerabilityAlerts` bypass the weekly schedule and concurrency cap
  entirely (`schedule: "at any time"`, `prConcurrentLimit: 0`): a real CVE
  gets an immediate PR, everything else stays batched.

  Two supply-chain defaults sit on top. `minimumReleaseAge: "3 days"` holds
  every third-party update until the release is three days old, long enough
  for a compromised release (tj-actions, March 2025) to be caught and pulled
  before it reaches us; Renovate raises security updates immediately
  regardless. `helpers:pinGitHubActionDigestsToSemver` pins each
  third-party action to a commit SHA with the version as a comment, so a
  re-pointed tag can't change what runs. Our own repos are exempt from both:
  the wait protects against someone else's release, and `@v1` stays a tag
  on purpose (see Versioning).

## Repo description and tags

Every repo must be identifiable from its GitHub page alone. `repo-topics.json` sets the rule:

* **A description**, 350 characters at most, with no em or en dashes.
* **Exactly one kind tag:** client-site, client-app, sales-demo, dd-site, dd-tooling, dd-product, personal or it-portfolio.
* **Exactly one status tag:** live, in-use, in-development, concept, demo-expired, reference or unverified.
* **A client-<name> tag** on client sites and apps, and **doman-digital** on everything except personal and it-portfolio repos.
* **Tech tags** from the list only.

It is enforced twice. The policy workflow fails any PR whose repo breaks the rule, and claude-kit's daily audit checks every repo, including the ones nobody opens a PR on and any new repo not yet registered. Add a word to `repo-topics.json` before using it anywhere.

## Versioning

Everything is consumed pinned to a tag (`@v1`), not `@main`: a breaking
change to the reusable workflow or the policy script shouldn't silently
break every caller at once. Bump the tag deliberately; let Renovate keep
each repo's pin current via its own PR.

### v1.0.1

Registers the existing main-repository weekly review calibration job with its owner, purpose and 120-minute cap. The reusable policy checks out the matching version of its budget and scripts. Main-repository consumers can select `@v1.0.1`; no existing tag is retargeted by this release.
